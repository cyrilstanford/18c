MAR Y.,C H A P. I.,Mary, the licrome of this 6Rion, was the daughter of Edward, who mar¬ ried Eliza, a con tie, fashionable girl, with a kind of indolence in her temper, which might be termed negative good-nature: her virtues, indeed, were all of that stamp. She carefully attended to the jhe-ws of things, and her opinions, I should have said prejudices, were such as the ; generality approved of. She was edu- i cared with the expectation of a large for- ■ tune, of course became a mere machine:,B the
the homage of her attendants made s great part of her puerile amusements, and she never imagined there were any rela¬ tive duties for her to fulfil: notions of her own consequence, by these means, were interwoven in her mind, and the years of youth spent in acquiring a few superficial accomplishments, without hav¬ ing any talk for them. When she was first introduced into the polite circle, sire danced with an officer, whom flic faintly wished to be united to ; but her father soon after recommending another in a more distinguished rank of lite, she rea¬ dily submitted to his will, and promised to love, honour, and obey, (a vicious fool,) as in duty bound.,While they resided in London, they lived in the usual fashionable style, and seldom saw each other; nor were they much more sociable when they wooed rural
rural felicity for more than half the year, in a delightful country, where Nature, with lavish hand, had scattered beauties around ; for the mailer, with brute, un¬ con Icious gaze, passed them by unobserv¬ ed, and fought amusement in country sports. He hunted in the morning, and after eating an immoderate dinner, ge¬ nerally fell asleep: this seasonable reft enabled him to digest the cumbrous load ; he would then visit some of his pretty tenants; and when he compared their ruddy glow of health with his wife s countenance, which even rouge could not enliven, it is not necessary to fay which a gourmand would give the preference to. Their vulgar dance of spirits were infinitely more agreeable to his fancy than her sickly, die-away lan¬ guor. Her voice was but the shadow of a found, and flic had, to complete her de-,B 2 licacv,
licacy, so relaxed her nerves, that flic be¬ came a mere nothing.,Many Inch noughts aic there in the female world! yet she had a good opi¬ nion of her own merit,—trulv, flic said long prayers,--and sometimes read her Week’s Preparation: she dreaded that horrid place vulgarly called hell, the re¬ gions below; but whether her’s was a mounting spirit, I cannot pretend to de¬ termine j or what sort of a planet would have been proper for her, when fire left her material part in this world, let meta¬ physicians settle; I have nothing to say to her unclothed spirit.,As she was sometimes obliged to be alone, or only with her French waiting¬ maid, she sent to the metropolis for all the new publications, and while she was dressing her hair, and she could turn her eyes from the glass, lire ran over 4 thole
those most delightful substitutes for bo¬ dily dissipation, novels. I fay bodily, or the animal foul, for a rational one can find no employment in polite circles. The glare of lights, the studied inclegan- cies of dress, and the compliments of¬ fered up at the shrine of false beauty, are all equally addressed to the lenses.,When she could not any longer in¬ dulge the caprices of fancy one way, she tried another. The Platonic Marriage, Eliza Warwick, and some other interest¬ ing tales were perilled with eagerness. Nothing could be more natural than the developement of the passions, nor more striking than the views of the human heart. What delicate draggles ! and uncommonly pretty turns of thought I The picture that was found on a bramble- bush, the new sensitive-plant, or tree, which caught the Iwa in by the upper-,B 3 gar-
( 6figeSs66 ),garment, and presented to his ravished eyes a portrait.—Fatal image ! — It plant¬ ed a thorn in a till then insensible heart, and lent a new kind of a knight-ci rant into the world. But even this was nothing to the catastrophe, and the circumstance on which it hung, the hornet fettling on the sleeping lover’s face. What a heart- tending accident ! She planted, in imi¬ tation of those susceptible souls, a rose bush; but there wa, not a lover to weep in concert with her, when she watered it with her tears. —Alas! Alas!,If my readers would excuse the spor- tiveness os fancy, and give me credit for genius, I would go on and tell them suck tales as would force the sweet tears of sensibility to flow in copious showers down beautiful cheeks, to the dis¬ composure os rouge, &c. &c. Nay, I would make it so interesting, that the fair
fair peruser should beg the hair-dresser to settle the curls himself, and not inter¬ rupt her.,She had besides another resource, twa most beautiful dogs, who shared her bed, and reclined on cushions near her all the dav. These she watched with the moss assiduous care, and bessowed on them the wariness caress, s. This fondness for ani¬ mals was not that In nd us,Kent which makes a perlon take plea¬ sure in providing for the subsidence and. comfort of a living creature; but it pro¬ ceeded from vanity, it gave her an op¬ portunity of lisping out the prettied French expressions of ecssatic fondness, in accents that had never been attuned by tenderness.,She was chasse, according to the vul¬ gar acceptation of the word, that is, Ihe did not make any a&uss faux fw; flic,B 4 feared
feared the world, and was indolent; but then, to make amends for this seeming self-denial, (he read all the sentimental novels, dwelt on the love-scenes, and, had Ihe thought while she read, her mind would have been contaminated; as she accompanied the lovers to the lonely ar¬ bors, and would walk with them by the clear light of the moon. She wondered her husband did not flay at home. She was jealous—why did he not love her, fit by her side, squeeze her hand, and look unutterable things ? Gentle reader, I will tell thee ; they neither of them felt what they could not utter. I will not pretend to fay that they always annexed an idea to a word j but they had none os those feelings which are not easily ana¬ lyzed.,C H A P
CHAP. II.,IN due time she brought forth a son, a feeble babe; and the following year a daughter. After the mother’s throes fire felt very few sentiments of maternal tenderness: the children were given to nurses, and she played with her dogs. Want of exercise prevented the least chance of her recovering strength ; and two<or three milk-fevers brought on a consumption, to which her constitution tended. Her children all died in their infancy, except the two first, and Ilie began to grow fond of the son, as he was remarkably handsome. For years she divided her time between the sofa, and the card-table. She thought not of death.
death, though on the borders of the grave; nor did any of the duties of her station occur to her as necessary. Her children were left in the nursery; and when Mary, the little blushing girl, ap¬ peared, she would send the awkward thing away. To own the truth, Hie was awkward enough, in a houie without any play-mates; for her brother had been lent to school, and she scarcely knew how to -employ herself; she would ramble about the garden, admire the flowers, and play with the dogs. An old house-keeper told her ftories, read to her, and, at last, taught her to read. Her mother talked of enquiring for a governess when her health would permit; and, in the interim •desired her own maid to teach her French. As she had learned to read, she perused with avidity every book that came in her way. Neglected in,fvery
( " ),fvcry respect, and left to the operations- of her own mind, lire considered every thing that came under her inspection, and learned to think. She had heard of a separate state, and that angels some¬ times visited this earth. She would fit in a thick wood in the park, and talk to them ; make little songs addressed to them, and ling them to tunes of her own composing; and her native wood notes,■ wild were sweet and touching.,Her hither always exclaimed against. ■ female acquirements, and was glad that his wife’s indolence and ill health made . her not trouble herself about them. She had besides another reason, she did not wish to have a fine tail girl brought for¬ ward into notice as her daughter; flic still expected to recover, and figure away in the gay world. Her husband was j very tyrannical and passionate; indeed so | very,1 1
very easily irritated when inebriated, that Mary was continually in diead left he should frighten her mother to death; her sickness called forth all Mary’s ten¬ derness, and exercised her companion so continually, that it became more than a match for self-love, and was the go¬ verning propensity of her heart through life. She was violent in her temper; but flae saw her father’s faults, and would weep when obliged to compare his tem¬ per with her own. - -She did more; artless prayers rose to Heaven for paidon, when (he was conscious of having erred ; and her contrition was so exceedingly painful, that Ihe watched diligently the first movements of anger and impatience, to save herself this cruel remorse.,Sublime ideas filled her young mind — always connected with devotional senti¬ ments ; extemporary effusions of grati¬ tude,
( i3 ),tude, and rhapsodies of praise would burst often from her, when she listened to the buds, or pursued the deer. She would gaze on the moon, and ramble through the gloomy path, observing the various shapes the clouds assumed, and listen to the sea that was not far distant. The wandering spirits, which she imagined inhabited every part of nature, were her constant friends and confidants. She began to consider rhe Great First Cause, formed just notions os his attributes, and, in particular, dwelt on 1 is wisdom and goodness. Could she have loved her father or mother, had they returned her affection, sse would not so soon, per¬ haps, have sought out a new world.,Her sensibility prompted her to search for an obsess to love ; on earth it was not to be found : her mother had often dis¬ appointed her, and the apparent par¬ tiality
tiaiity Hie shewed to her brother gave her exquisite pain —produced a kind of ha- •bitual melancholy, led her into a fond¬ ness for reading tales of woe, and made her almost realize the fictitious distress.,She had not any notion of death till a little chicken expired at her feet; and her father had a dog hung in a passion. She then concluded animals had fouls, or they would not have been subjected to the caprice of man ; but what was the foul of man or beast ? In this style year after year rolled on, her mother still ve¬ getating.,A little girl who attended in the nur¬ sery fell sick. Mary paid her great at¬ tention ; contrary to her wish, she was sent out of the house to her mother, a poor woman, whom necessity obliged to leave her sick child while she earned her daily bread. The poor wretch, in a fit
( ),fit of delirium stabbed herself, and Mary saw her dead body, and heard the dismal account; and so strongly did it impress her imagination, that every night of her life the bleeding corpse presented itself to her when flic first began to dumber. Tortured by it, die at last made a vow, that if die was ever mistress of a family die would herself watch over every part of it. The impression that this accident made was indelible.,As her mother grew imperceptibly worse and worse, her father, who did not underhand Inch a lingering complaint, imagined his wife was only grown still more whimsical, and that if die could be prevailed on to exert herself, her health would soon be re-established. In gene¬ ral he treated her with indifference; but when her illness at all interfered with his pleasures, he expostulated in the most 3 cruel
cruel manner, and visibly harassed the invalid. Mary would then assiduously try to turn his attention to something else; and when sent out of the room, would watch at the door, until the dorm was over, for unless it was, she could not red. Other causes also contributed to disturb her repole: her mother';,1Iil’‘'s luke¬ warm manner of performing her reli¬ gious duties, filled her with anguish; and when fire observed her father’s vices, the unbidden tears would flow. She was miserable when beggars were driven from the gate without being relieved; if she could do it unperceived, she would give them her ow.i breakfad, and feel grati¬ fied, when, in consequence of it, she was pinched by hunger.,She had once, or twice, told her little secrets to her mother 5 they were laughed Lt, and she determined never to do it again.
again. In this manner was fire left to reflect on her own feelings; and so strengthened were they by being medi¬ tated on, that her character early became singular and permanent. Her under¬ standing was strong and clear, when not clouded by her feelings; but she was too much the creature of impulse, and tire stave of companion.,C,chap
( i8 ),CHA P. III.,Near her father’s house lived a poor widow, who had been brought up in af¬ fluence, but reduced to great distress by the extravagance of her husband ; he had destroyed his constitution while he spent his fortune; and dying, left his wife, and five small children, to live on a very scanty pittance. The eldest daugh¬ ter was scr some years educated by a distant relation, a Clergyman. While flie was with him a young gentle¬ man, son to a man of property in the neighbourhood, took particular notice of her. It is true, he never talked of love; but then they played and sung in concert; drew landscapes together, and while she worked he read to her, culti¬ vated
( ),vated her taste, and stole imperceptibly her heart. Just at this juncture, when smiling, unanalyzed hope made every prospect bright, and gay expectation danced in her eyes, her benefactor died. She re¬ turned to her mother—the companion of her youth forgot her, they took no more sweet counsel together. This disap¬ pointment spread a sadness over her countenance, and made it interesting. She grew fond of solitude, and her cha¬ racter appeared umdar to Mary’s, though her natural disposition was very di/furent.,She was several years older than Maty, yet her refinement, her taste, caught her eye, and she eagerly sought her iriendstjp: before her return she had assisted the family, which was almost re¬ duced to the last ebb; and now she had .another motive to actuate her.,C 2 As
As (lie had often occasion to fend mes¬ sages to Ann, her new friend, mistakes were frequently made; Ann proposed that in future they should be written ones, to ob¬ viate this difficulty, and render their inter¬ course more agreeable. Young people are mostly fond of scribbling ; Mary had had very little instruction; but by co¬ pying her friend’s letters, whose hand she admired, fire soon became a proficient; a little practice made her write with to¬ lerable correctness, and her genius gave force to it. In conversation, and in writing, when fine felt, flic was pathetic, tender and persuasive ; and she expressed contempt with such energy, that few could stand the flash of her eyes.,As she grew more intimate with Ann, her manners were softened, and fine ac¬ quired a degree of equality in her be¬ haviour : yet still her spirits were fluc- tuatinsz.
touting, and her movements rapid. She felt less pain on account of her mother,Tt1Iil’'*'s partiality to her brother, as Ine hoped, now to experience the pleasure of being beloved; but this ho^e led her into new sorrows, and, as usual, paved the way for disappointment. Ann only Lit grati¬ tude ; her heart was cr.tbdy engrossed by one object, and friendship could nor Rime as a substitute ; memory officiously retraced paid scenes, and unavailing wishes made time loiter.,Mary was often hurt by the involun¬ tary indifference which these conse¬ quences produced. When her friend was all the world to her, she found she,was not as necessary to her happiness; and her delicate mind could not bear to obtrude her affection, or receive love as an aims, the offspring of pitv. Very frequently has Ilie ran to her with de- C 3 light,
( 22 ),light, and not perceiving any thing of the fame kind in Ann’s countenance, flic has shrunk back; and, falling from one extreme into the other, inRead of a warm greeting that was juft flipping from her tongue, her expressions seemed to be dictated by the most chilling in¬ sensibility.,She would then imagine that she look¬ ed sickly or unhappy, and then all her ten¬ derness would return like a torrent, and bear away all reflection. In this man¬ ner was her sensibility called foith, and exercised, by Kr mother’s illnds, her friend’s misfortunes, and her own un¬ settled mind.,C I-I A P.
CHAP. IV.,Near to her father’s house was a ranse of mountains; some of them were, literally speaking, cloud-capt, for on them clouds continually rested, and gave grandeur to the prospect; and down many of their sides the little bubbling cascades ran till they swelled a beautiful river. Through the straggling trees and bushes the wind whistled, and on them the birds sung, particularly the robins; they also found shelter in the ivy of an old castle, a haunted one, as the story went; it was situated on the brow of one of the mountains, and commanded a view of the lea. This castle had been inhabited by some of her ancestors; and,C 4 manv
many tales had the old house-keeper told her of the worthies who had resided there.,When her mother frowned, and her friend looked cool, Hie would Ileal to this retirement, where human foot sel¬ dom trod—gaze on the sea, observe the grey clouds, or listen to the wind which struggled to free itself from the only thing that impeded its course. When more cheerful, site admired the various dispositions of light and shade, the beau¬ tiful tints the gleams of sunshine gave to the distant hills; then she rejoiced in ex¬ istence, and darted into futurity.,Oneway home was through the cavitv of a rock covered with a thin layer of earth, ]ult sufficient to afford nourishment to a few stunted shrubs, and w ilJ plants, which grew on its fides, and nodded over the summit. A clear ijeam broke out of
of it, and ran amongst the pieces of rocks fallen into it. Here twilight al¬ ways reigned—it seemed the Temple of Solitude; yet, paradoxical as the asser¬ tion may appear, when the foot founded on the rock, it terrified th. intruder, and inspired a strange feeling, as if the rightful sovereign was dislodged. In this retreat she read Thomson’s Seasons, Young’s Night-Thoughts, and Paradise Lost.,At a little distance from it were the huts of a few poor fishermen, who sup¬ ported their numerous children by their precarious labour. In these little huts she frequently rested, and denied herself every childish gratification, in order to relieve the necessities of the inhabitants. Her heart yearned for them, and would dance with joy when she had relieved •their wants, or afforded them pleasure.,;iJj; In
In these pursuits site learned the luxury of doing good; and the sweet tears of benevolence frequently moistened her eyes, and gave them a sparkle which, exclusive of that, they had not; on the contrary, they were rather fixed, and would never have been observed is her soul had not animated them. They were not at all like thole brilliant ones which look like polished diamonds, and dart from every luperfice, giving more light to the beholders than they receive them¬ selves.,Her benevolence, indeed, knew no bounds; the distress of others carried her out of herself; and she rested not till she had relieved or comforted them. The warmth os her compassion often made her so diligent, that many things oc¬ curred to her, which might have escaped a loss interested observer.,In
( 27 ),In like manner, she entered with such spirit into whatever she read, and the emotions thereby raised were so strong, that it soon became a part os her mind.,Enthusiastic sentiments of devotion at this period actuated her; her Creator was almost apparent to her senses in his works; but they were mostly the grand or solemn features of Nature which she de¬ lighted to contemplate. She would stand and behold the waves rolling, and think of the voice that could still the tumultuous deep.,These propensities gave the colour to her mind, before the passions began to exercise their tyrannic sway, and particu¬ larly pointed out those which the foil Would have a tendency to nurse.,Years after, when wandering through the lame scenes, her imagination has strayed back, to trace the first placid sen¬ timents
sentiments they inspired, and fee would earnestly desire to regain the same peace¬ ful tranquillity.,Many nights she sat up, if I may be allowed the expression, conversing with the Author of Nature, making verses, and singing hymns of her own composing. She considered also, and tried to discern what end her various faculties were de¬ stined to pursue ; and had a glimpse of a truth, which afterwards more fully un¬ folded itself.,She thought that only an infinite be¬ ing could fill the human soul, and that when other objects were followed as a means of hat i inefs, the delusion led to misery, the consequence of disappoint¬ ment. Und-.r the influence of ardent affections, how often has fee forgot this conviction, and as often returned to it again, when it struck her with redoubled force.
force. Often did she taste unmixed de¬ light; her joys, her ecstacies arose from genius.,Sire was now fifteen, and flic wished to receive the holy lacrament; and per¬ using the scriptures, and discussing some points of doctrine which puzzled a er, she would fit up half tire night, her fa¬ vourite time for employing her mind; she too plainly perceived that site saw through a glass darkly; and that the bounds stt to stop our intellectual re¬ searches, is one of the trials of a proba¬ tionary state.,But her affections were roused by the diiplay of divine mercy; and she eagerly desired to commemorate the dying love of her great benefactor. The nictn before the important day, when she was to take on herlelf her baptismal vow, she could not go to bed; the fan broke in on her meditations,
( 30 ) meditations, and found her not exhausted :;fsJj;::by her watching.,The orient pearls were strewed around — she hailed the morn, and fung with wild delight, Glory to God on high, good will towards men. She was in¬ deed so much affected when Ute joined in the prayer for her eternal preservation, that site could hardly conceal her violent emotions; and the recollection never failed to wake her dormant piety when earthly passions made it grow languid.,These various movements of her mind were not commented on, nor were the luxuriant shoots restrained by culture. The servants and the poor adored her.,In order to be enabled to gratify her¬ self in the highest degree, sue practised the most rigid œconomy, and had such power over her appetites and whims, that without any great effort flic conquered,4 them
( V ),them so entirely, that when her under¬ standing or affections had an object, Hie almost forgot she had a body which re¬ quired nourishment.,This habit of thinking, this kind of absorption, gave strength to the pas¬ sions.,We will now enter on the more active field of life.,C I I A P,
CHAP. V.,A FEW months after Mary was turned of seventeen, her brother was attacked by a violent fever, and died before his father could reach the school.,She was now an heiress, and her mo¬ ther began to think her of consequence, and did not call her the child. Proper •masters were sent for; she was taught to ■dance, and an extraordinary master pro¬ cured to perfect her in that most necessary of all accomplishments.,A part of the estate she was to inherit had been litigated, and the heir of the person who still carried on a Chancery suit, was only two years younger than our heroine. The fathers, spite of tire •dispute,
dispute, frequently met, and, in order to settle it amicably, they one day, over a bottle, determined to quash it by a mar¬ riage, and, by uniting the two estates, to preclude all farther enquiries into the merits of their different claims.,While this important matter was fet¬ tling, Mary was otherwise employed. Ann’s mother’s resources were failing; and the gh istly phantom, poverty, made hasty llrides to catch them in his clutches. Ann had not fortitude enough to brave such accumulated misery; besides, the canker-worm was lodged in her heart, and preyed on her health. She denied herself every little comfort; things that would be no sacrifice when a person is well, are absolutely necessary to alleviate bodily pain, and support the animal ffnehons.,I) shore
There were many elegant amusements that Hie had acquired a relish for, which might have taken her mind off from its most destructive bent; but thcle her in¬ digence would not allow her to enjoy: forced then, by way of relaxation, to play the tunes her lover admired, and handle the pencil he taught her to hold, no wonder his image floated on her imagi¬ nation, and that taste invigorated love.,Poverty, and all its inelegant attend¬ ants, were in her mother’s abode; and Ihe, though a good fort of a woman, was not calculated to banish, by her tri¬ vial, uninteresting chat, the delirium in which her daughter was lost.,This ill-fated love had given a be¬ witching softness to her manners, a de¬ licacy so truly feminine, that a man ot any feeling could not behold her with¬ out wishing to chase her sorrows away.,2 She
She was timid and irresolute, and rather fond of dissipation ; grief only had power to make her reflect.,In every thing it was not the great, but the beautiful, or the pretty, that caught her attention. And in composi¬ tion, the polish of style, and harmony of numbers, interested her much more than the flights of genius, or abstracted speculations.,She often wondered at the books Mary chose, who, though fine had a lively imagination, would frequently study authors whose works were addressed to the understanding. This liking taught her to arrange her thoughts, and argue with herself, even when under the influ¬ ence of the most violent passions.,Ann’s misfortunes and ill health were strong tics to bind Mary to her; she wished so continually to have a home to,D 2 receive
( ),receive her in, that it drove every other desire out of her mind; and, dwelling on the tender schemes which compassion and friendship dictated, site longed moil ardently to put them in practice.,Fpndly as she loved her friend, she did not forget her mother, whole decline was so imperceptible, that they were not aware of her approaching dissolution. The physician, however, observing the molt alarming symptoms; her husband was apprised of her immediate danger. and then first mentioned to her his de¬ signs with respect to his daughter.,She approved of them; Mary was sent for; flic was not at home ; she had rambled to visit Ann, and sound her :a an hysteric fit. The landlord of her little farm had sent his agent for the rent, which had long been due to him ; and he threatened to seize the stock that still remam.A
remained, and turn them our, if they did not very shortly discharge the arrears.,As this man made a private fortune by harassing the tenants of the pci son to whom he was deputy, little was to be expected from hi) forbearance.,All this was told to Mary—and the mother added, she had many other cre¬ ditors who would, in all probability, take the alarm, and snatch from them all that had been laved out of the wreck, " I " could bear all,” Ilie cried , “ but what “ will become of my children ? Of " this child,” pointing to the fainting Ann, “ whose constitution is already un- “ de rm in ed by care and grief--where “ will she go r”—Mary"'-¬,1Iil’'s heart ceased to beat while she a iked the question -She attempted to speak ; but the inarticulate sounds died away. Before die had re- ',■1Iil|—’‘'.overed herself, her father called him-,J) J self
self to enquire for her 5 and desired her instantly to accompany him home.,Engrossed by the scene of misery she had been witness to, she walked silently by his side, when he routed her out of her reverie by telling her that in all likelihood her mother had not many hours to live; and before she could re¬ turn him any answer, informed her that they had both determined to marry her to Charles, his friend’s son; he added, the ceremony was to be performed dirccdv, that her mother might be witness of it; for such a desire she had expressed vs: st. childish eagerness.,Overwhelmed by this intelligence, Mary rolled her eyes about, then, with a vacant stare, fixed them on her father'’°'s face; but they were no longer a sense; they conveyed no ideas to the brain. As she drew near the house, her wonted presence
presence of mind returned : after this suspension of thought, a thousand darted into her mind,—her dying mother,—her friend’s miserable situation,— and an ex¬ treme horror at taking —at being forced to take, such a hally Hep; but she did not feel the difgull, the reluctance, which arises from a prior attachment.,She loved Ann better than any one in the world—to snatch her from the very jaws of destruction— Ilie would have en¬ countered a lion. To have this friend constantly with her; to make her mind easy with respect to her family, would it not be superlative bills ?,Pull of these thoughts flic entered her mother’s chamber, but they then fled at the light of a dying parent. She went to her, took her hand; it feebly prefled her’s. " My child," said the languid mother: the words reached her heart;,D 4 flic
Ihe had seldom heard them pronounced with accents denoting affection; " My “ child, I have not always treated you “ with kindness- God forgive me ! do “ you r”—Mary’s tears strayed in a dis¬ regarded stream ; on her bosom the big drops fell, but did not relieve the flut¬ tering tenant, “ I forgive you 1” said she, in a tone of astonishment.,The clergyman came in to read the ser¬ vice for the sick, and afterwards the mar¬ riage ceremony was performed. Mary stood like a statue of Despair, and pro- nounced the awful vow without thinking of it; and then ran to support her mo¬ ther, who expired the same night in Iter arms.,Her husband set off for the continent the fame day, with a tutor, to fin.fh his studies at one of the foreign univer¬ sities.,Ann
Ann was sent for to console her, not on account of the departure of her new relation, a boy site seldom took any no¬ tice of, but to reconcile her to her fate; beud--¬'.">'s, it was necessary flic should have a lemale companion, and there was not anv maiden aunt in the family, or cousin os the lame class.,CHAP.
CHAP. VI.,JMlARY was allowed to pay the rent which gave her so much uneasincls, and she exerted every nerve to prevail on he: father effectually to succour the family, but the utmost she could obtain was a small sum very inadequate to the pur¬ pose, to enable the poor woman to carry into execution a little Icheme os industry near the metropolis.,Her intention of leaving that part of the country, had much more weight with him, than Mary’s arguments, drawn from motives of philanthropy and friend¬ ship ; this was a language he did not understand, expressive of occult qualities he
he never thought of, as they could not be seen or felt.,After the departure of her mother, Ann still continued to languish, though she had a nurie who was entirely en- ^rolled by the desire of amusing her. Had her health been rc-cfbiblifhcd, the time would have passed in a tranquil, im- proving manner.,During the year of mourning they lived in retirement; music, drawing, and rinding, filled up the time; and,,'■1Iil|—>’1 Mary,■1Iil'’‘'s take and ludgmtm were both improved bv contracting a habit of ob¬ servation, and permitting the simple beauties of Nature to occupy her thoughts.,She had a wonderful quickness in dis¬ cerning distinctions and combining ideas, that at the first glance did not appear to be similar.

CHAP. VIII.,I MENTIONED before, that Mary had never had any particular attachment, to give rise to the disgust that daily gained ground. Her friendship for Ann occupied her heart, and resembled a passion. She had had, indeed, several transient likings; but they did not amount to love.

with the sailors, and fuivcycd the boundless expanse before her with de- Jighr. One instant (lie would regard the ocean, the next the beings who braved its fury.

After the customary visits, they were permitted to go on shore, about three miles from the city ; and while one of the crew, who understood the language, went to procure them one of the ugly carriages peculiar to,the count:v, they waited in the Irish convent, which is si¬ tuated close to the Tagus.,E 4 Some
Some of the people offered to conduct them into the church, where there was a fine organ playing; Mary followed them, but Ann preferred slaying with a nun she had entered into conversation with.,One of the nuns,- who had a fwmt voice, was singing; Mary was firms with awe; her heart joined in the devo¬ tion ; and tears of gratitude and tender¬ ness flowed from her eyes.

Silently, she surveyed the lofty dome; heard unaccustomed founds; and saw faces, strange ones, that flic could not yet greet with fraternal love.,In an unknown land, she considered that the Being she adored inhabited eter¬ nity, was ever present in unnumbcicd worlds. When site had not any one she loved near her, fire was particularly sen¬ sible

Thev entered into conversation immediately.,People who meet in a strange country, and are all together in a house, soon gr acquainted, without the formalities which attend visiting in separate houses, where they are surrounded by domestic friends. Ann was particularly delighted at meet¬ ing with agreeable society; a little -hectic fever generally made her low- spirited in the morning, and lively in the evening, when she wished for com¬ pany. Mary, who only thought of her, determined to cultivate their acquaint¬ ance, as she knew, that if her mind could be diverted, her body might gam strength.,Thev
They were all musical, and proposed having little concerts. One of the gen- demen played on the violin, and the ether on the german-flute. The instru¬ ments were brought in, with all the eagerness that attends putting a new scheme in execution.,Mary had not said much, for she was diffident; site seldom joined in general conversations; though her quickness of penetration enabled her soon to enter ■ into the characters of thole flic con- . versed vith ; and her sensibility made her ■ desirous of pleasing every human crea¬ ture. Besides, if her mind was not oc¬ cupied by any particular sorrow, or study, she caught reflected pleasure, and was glad to fee others happv, though ■ their mirth did not interest her.,This day she was continually think - ■ trig of Ann’s recovery, and encouraging the,I,G i
the cheerful hopes, which though the dissipated the spirits that had been eon-; denied by melancholy, yet made U; wish to be silent. The music, more tina; the conversation, disturbed her reflections; but not at first. The gentleman vT played on the german-flute, was a handlome, veil-bred, sensible man ; and his observations, if not original, vm pertinent.,The other, who had not said much began to touch the violin, and played a little Scotch ballad ; he brought sue;, a thrilling sound out of the instrument, that Mary started, and looking at him with more attention than she had done before, and saw, in a face rather ugly, strong lines of genius. His manncu were awkward, that kind of awkwardness which is often found in literary men: he seemed a thinker, and delivered his opinions
opinions in elegant expressions, and mu¬ sical tones of voice.,When the concert was over, they all retired to their apartments. Marv al¬ ways slept with Ann, as she was subject: to terrifving dreams; and frequently in '•■’‘'the night was obliged to be supported, ‘to avoid suffocation. They chatted about .their new acquaintance in their own -apartment, and, with respect: to the gentlemen, differed in opinion.,C H A P.
CHAP. X.,EvERY day almost they saw their rA acquaintance; and civility produced inti-i macy. Mary sometimes lest her frAs with them; while Hie indulged herself h viewing new modes os life, and searching out the causes which produced them. She had a metaphysical turn, which incline! her to reflect on every object that passed by her; and her mind was not like a mirrer, which receives every floating image, bu does not retain them: fine had not any prejudices, for every opinion was ex- .am in ed before it was adopted.,The Roman Catholic ceremonies at¬ tracted her attention, and gave rife 3 conversations when they all met; ant ent,3
one of the gentlemen continually intro¬ duced deistical notions, when he ridi¬ culed the pageantry they all were sur¬ prised at observing. Mary thought of both the subjects, the Romish tenets, and the deiftical doubts; and though not a sceptic, thought it right to exa¬ mine the evidence on which her faith was built. She read Butler’s Analogy, and some other authors: and these researches made her a christian from conviction, and site learned charity, particularly with respect to sectaries; saw that appa¬ rently good and solid arguments might take their rife from different points of i view; and she rejoiced to find that those she should not concur with had some reason on their side.,CHAP,
CHAP. XL,When I mentioned the three lad A,I said they were fashionable women ; and it was all the praise, as a faithful hiilo- rian, I could bestow on them; the only thing in which they were consistent. I forgot to mention that they were all L one family, a mother, her daughter, and niece. The daughter was sent by her physician, to avoid a northerly winter; the mother, her niece, and nephew, ac¬ companied her.,They were people of rank; but un¬ fortunately, though of an ancient sandy, the title had descended to a very remote branch—a branch they took care to be intimate
rati mate with ; and servilely copied the Countess’s airs. Their minds were shack - led with a set of notions concerning pro¬ priety, the fitness of things for the world’s eye, trammels which always hamper weak people. What will the world fay ? was the first thing that was thought of, when they intended doing any thing they had not done before. Or what would the Countess do on such an occasion ? And when this question was answered, the right or wrong was disco¬ vered without the trouble os their having any idea os the matter in their own heads. This fame Countess was a fine planet, and the satellites observed a most harmonic dance around her.,Aster this account it is scarcely neces¬ sary to add, that their minds had received very little cultivation. Thcv were taught French, Italian, and Spanish ; English F was
was their vulgar tongue. And what did they learn ? Hamlet will tell you— words —words. But let me not forget that they squalled Italian longs in the true gusto. Without having any feeds sown in their understanding, or the as¬ sertions of the heart set to work, they were brought out of their nursery, or the place they were secluded in, to prevent their faces being common ; like blazing stars, to captivate Lords.,They were pretty, and hurrying from one party of pleasure to another, occa¬ sioned the disorder which required change of air. The mother, if we ex¬ cept her being near twenty years older, was juft the fame creature; and these additional years only served to make her more tenaciously adhere to her habits of folly, and decide with stupid gravity, some trivial points of ceremony, as a matter
matter of the last importance; of which flie was a competent judge, from hav¬ ing lived in the fashionable world so long: that world to which the igno¬ rant look, up as we do to the fun.,It appears to me that every creature has some notion—or rather relish, of the sub¬ lime. Riches, and the consequent state, are the sublime of weak mindsThese images fill, nay, are too big for their narrow louis.,One afternoon, which they had en¬ gaged to spend together, Ann was so ill, that Mary was obliged to lend an apology for not attending the tea-table. The apology brought them on the carpet; and the mother, with a look of solemn importance, turned to the sick man, whose name was Henry, and said ; “ Though people of the first fashion are " frequently at places of this kind, inti-,F 2 mate,i
" mate with they know not who; yeti " do not choose that my daughter, vdios " family is so respectable, stiould be i;- “ timate with any one she would bios “ to know elsewhere.

Henry sigh¬ ed, and strode across the room once or twice 5 then took up his violin, and played the air which first struck Mary ; he had often heard her praise it.,The music was uncommonly melo¬ dious, " And came stealing on the “ senses like the sweet south.” The . well-known founds reached Mary as sue fat by her friend—she listened ■without knowing thatdhe did —and died rears j F y almost
almost without being conscious of Ann soon fell asleep, as flic had take: an opiate. Mary, then brooding over her fears, began to imagine she had de¬ ceived herself—Ann was still very ill; hope had beguiled many heavy hours;',1Iil|—!]’1 yet she was displeased with herself for ad¬ mitting this welcome guest. —And Ike worked up her mind to such a degreed anxiety, that fire determined, once more, to feck medical aid. j,No sooner did fine determine, than she j ran down with a discomposed look, to enquire of the ladies who she should send for. ■•'‘’�'When site entered the room she could not articulate her fears —it ap¬ peared like pronouncing Ann’s sentence of death; her filtering tongue dropped some broken words, and she remained silent. The ladies wondered that a per¬ son of her sense should be so fade miMls
mistress of herself; and began to ad¬ minister some common-place comfort, as, that it was our duty to submit to the will of Heaven, and the like trite conso¬ lations, which Mary did not answer; but waving her hand, with an air of impa¬ tience, flic exclaimed, " I cannot live " without her 1—I have no other friend; " if I lose her, what a desart will the " world be to me.” " No other “ friend,” re-echoed they, " have you “ not a husband ?”,Mary shrunk back, and was alternately pale and red. A delicate sense of pro¬ priety prevented her replying; aM re¬ called her bewildered reason.— Assuming, in consequence of her recollection, a more composed manner, she made the intended enquiry, and left the room.

XIL,1 HE physician was sent for; his pre¬ scription afforded Ann a little temporary relief; and they again joined the circle, Unfortunately, the weather happened to be constantly wet for more than a week, and confined them to the house. Ann then found the ladies not so agreeable; when they sat whole hours together, the thread-bare topics were exhausted ; and, but for cards or music, the long even¬ ings would have been yawned away in listless indolence.,The bad weather had had as ill an c sth Oh on Henry as on Ann. He v as frequently very thoughtful, or rather me¬ lancholy ; this melancholy would el itself
itself have attracted Mary’s notice, if she had not found his conversation so in¬ finitely superior to the rest of the group. When she conversed with him, all the faculties of her soul unfolded themselves; genius animated her expressive counte¬ nance ; and the most graceful, unaffected gestures gave energy to her discourse.,They frequently discussed very im¬ portant subjects, while the rest were singing or playing cards, nor were they observed for doing so, as Henry, whom they all were pleased with, in the way of gallantry shewed them all more attention than her. Besides, as there was nothing alluring in her dress or manner, they never dreamt of her being preferred to them.,Henry was a man of learning; he had allo studied mankind, and knew many of the intricacies of the human heart, from having
,r<''having felt the infirmities of his own. His tafte was juft, as it had a standard— Nature, which he observed with a criti¬ cal eye. Mary could not help thinking that in his company her mind expanded, as he always went below the surface. She increased her stock of ideas, and her tafte was improved.,He was also a pious man ; his rational religious sentiments received warmth from his sensibility ; and, except on very particular occasions, kept it in proper bounds; these sentiments had likewise formed his temper; he was gentle, and easily to be intreated. The ridiculous ceremonies they were every day witness to, led them into what are termed grave subjects, and made him explain his opi¬ nions, which, at other times, he was neither ashamed of, nor unnecessarily brought forward to notice.,CHAP,
C H A P. XIII,"WHEN the weather began to clear- up, Mary sometimes rode out alone, purposely to view the ruins that still re¬ mained of the earthquake : or flic would ride to the banks of the Tagus, to feast her eves with the fight of that magnifi¬ cent river. At other times she would visit the churches, as she was particularly fond of feeing historical paintings.,One of these visits gave rife to the subject, and the whole party descanted'°"' on it; but as the ladies could not handle it well, they soon adverted to portraits; and talked of the attitudes and charac¬ ters in which they should wish to be drawn. Mary did not fix on one—when Henry,
( 76 ),Henry, with more apparent warmth than usual, said, " I would give the world " for your picture, with the expression " I have seen in your face, when you " have been supporting your friend.’’,This delicate compliment did not gratify her vanity, but it reached her heart. She then recollected that she had once sat for her picture—for whom was it designed ? For a boy I Her checks flushed with indignation, so strongly did she feel an emotion of contempt at hav¬ ing been thrown away—given in with an estate.,As Mary again gave way to hope, her mind was more disengaged ; and her thoughts were employed about the objects around her.,Sire visited several convents, and sound that solitude only eradicates some passions, to give strength to others; the most
most baneful ones. She saw that religion does not consist in ceremonies; and that many prayers may fall from the lips without purifying the heart.,They who imagine they can be reli¬ gious without governing their tempers, or exercising benevolence in its most ex¬ tensive sense, must certainly allow, that their religious duties arc only practised from selfish principles; how then can they be called good ? The pattern of all goodness went about doing good. Wrapped up in themselves, the nuns only thought of inferior gratifications. And a number of intrigues were carried on to accelerate certain points on which their hearts were fixed:,Such as obtaining offices of trust or authority; or avoiding those that were servile or laborious. In short, when they could be neither wives nor mothers, they
they aimed at being superiors, and be¬ came the most selfish creatures in the world: the passions that were curbed gave strength to the appetites, or to those mean passions which only tend to provide for the gratification of them. Was this seclusion from the world ? or did they conquer its vanities or avoid its vexa- .lions r,In these abodes the unhappy indivi- dual, who, in the first paroxysm of grief, files to them for refuge, finds too late she took a wrong step. The fame warmth which determined her will make -her repent; and sorrow, the rub of the mind, will never have a chance of being rubbed off by sensible conversa¬ tion, or new-born affections of the heart.,She will find that those affection^ that have once been called forth and 4 -strength-
strengthened by exercise, are only smo¬ thered, not killed, by disappointment; and that in one form or other discontent will corrode the heart, and produce those maladies os the imagination, for which there is no specific.,The community at large Mary dis¬ liked; but pitied many of them whose private distresses she was informed os; and to pity and relieve were the same things with her.,The exercise os her various virtues gave vigor to her genius, and dignity to her mind; she was sometimes inconsi¬ derate, and violent; but never mean or cunning.,C H A P,
( So ),CHAP. XIV.,THE Portuguese are certainly the most uncivilized nation in Europe. Dr. Johnson would have said, " They have the least mind.” , And can such serve their Creator in spirit and in truth ? No, the gross ritual os Ro¬ mish ceremonies is all they can compre¬ hend : they can do penance, but not con¬ quer their revenge, or lust. Religion, or love, has never humanized their hearts; they want the vital parr; the mere body worships. Taste is un¬ known ; Gothic finery, and unnatu¬ ral decorations, which they term or¬ naments, are conspicuous in them churches and dress. Reverence for mental
mental excellence is only to be found in a polished nation.,Could the contemplation of such a people gratify Mary’s heart ? No : she turned disguised from the prospects — turned to a man of refinement. Henry had been some time ill and low-spirited ; Mary would have been attentive to any one in that situation; but to him she was particularly sa; fire thought herself bound in gratitude, on account of his con¬ stant endeavours to amuse Ann, and pre¬ vent her dwelling on the dreary prospect before her, which sometimes Ilie could not help anticipating with a kind of quiet despair.,She found some excuse for going more frequently into the room■'•,‘’�'they all met in ; nay, she avowed her desire to amuse him: offered -to read to him, and tried to draw him into amusing conversations;,G and
and when flic was full of these schemes, flic looked at him with a degree of tenderness that she was not conscious of. This divided attention was of use to her, and prevented her continual iv thinking of Ann. whose fluctuating dis¬ order often gave rile to false hopes.,A trifling tiling occurred now which occasioned Mary some uneasiness. Her maid, a well-looking girl, had capti¬ vated the clerk of a neighbouring compting-houfe. As the match was an advantageous one, Mary could not raik any objection to it, though at this junc¬ ture it was very disagreeable to her to have a stranger about her person. How¬ ever, the girl consented to delay the marriage, as she had some affection for her mistress; and, besides, looked for¬ ward to Ann’s death as a tune of har¬ vest..,Henri v
Henry'",■1Iil’'s illness was not alarming, it was rather pleasing, as it gave Mary an excuse to hcrlelt lor shewing him how much site was interested about him ; and giving little artless proofs of affection, which the purity of her heart made her never wish to restrain.,The only visible return he made was not obvious to common observers. He would sometimes fix his eyes on her, and take them off with a sigh that was coughed awav; or when he was leisurely walking into the room, and did not ex¬ pect to fee her, he would quicken his steps, and come up to her with eagerness to a Ik some trivial question. In the fame stvle, he would try to detain her when he had nothing to fay— or said no¬ thing.,Ann did not take notice of either his or Mary’s behaviour, nor did she suspect,G 2 that
that he was a favourite, on any other account than his appearing neither well nor happy. She had often seen that when a person was unfortunate, Mary’s pity might easily be mistaken for love, and, indeed, it was a temporary sensa¬ tion of that kind. Such it was—why it was so, let others define, I cannot argus against instincts. As reason is cultivated in man, they are supposed to grow weaker, and this may have given rife to the assertion, " That as judgment " proves, genius evaporates,”,CHAP.
CHA P. XV.,OnE morning they set out to visit the aqueduct; though the day was very fine when they left home, a very heavy slower fell before they reached it; they lengthened their ride, the clouds dis¬ persed, and the sun came from behind them uncommonly bright.,Mary would fain have persuaded Ann not to have left the carriage; but flit was in spirits, and obviated all her objections, and insisted on walking, tho’ the ground was damp. But her strength was not equal to her spirits; she was soon obliged to return to the carriage so much fatigued, that she fainted, and remained insensible a long time.,G j Henry
Henry would have supported her; but Mary would not permit him; her recol¬ lection was instantaneous, and flic feared fitting on the damp ground might do him a material injury: she was on that account positive, though the company did not guess the cause of her being so. As to herself, Ihe did not fear bodily pain; and, when her mind was agitated, she could endure the greatest fatigue without appearing sensible of it.,When Ann recovered, they returned slowly home; she was carried to bed, and the next morning Mary thought flic observed a visible change for the worse. The physician was sent for, who pro¬ nounced her to be in the most imminent danger.,All Mary’s former fears now returned like a torrent, and carried every other care away; she even added to her pre¬ sent

Site desired her maid to conclude her marriage, and request her intended husband to inform her when the first merchantman was to leave the port, as the packet had just sailed, and site determined not to stay in that hated place any longer than was ab¬ solutely necessary.,She then sent to request the ladies to visit her; she wished to avoid a parade of grief—her sorrows were her own, and appeared to her not to admit of increase or softening. She was right; the fight of them did not affect her, or turn the stream of her sullen sorrow; the black wave rolled along in the same course; it was equal to her where she cast her eyes; ail was impenetrable gloom.,C H A P.

She ran eagerly up to him—saw the tear trembling in his eye, and his countenance softened by the tendereft compassion; the hand which pressed hers seemed that of a fellow-creature. She burse into tears; and, unable to restrain them, sire hid her face with both her hands: these tears relieved Iter, (she had before had a difficulty in breathing,) and she sat down by him more composed than

" My father died before I knew Uu“�u him, and my mother was so attached " to my eldest brother, that she took “ very little pains to fit me for the '�'-¬'°"' profession to which I was destined: " and,

" I kept up an irregular corre- “ st ondence with my mother; my bro- " thvr’s extravagance and ingratitude ” had almost biokcn her heart, and “ made
" made her feel something like a pan;; " of remorse, on account of her beha- " viour to me. I hastened to comfort “ her—and was a comfort to her.," My declining health prevented my " taking orders, as I had intended ; but " I with warmth entered into literary " pursuits; perhaps my heart, not hav- " ing an object, made me embrace the " substitute with more eagerness. But, " do not imagine I have always been a " die-away swain. No: I have fre- “ quented the cheerful haunts of men, " and wit!—enchanting wit! has made " many moments fly free from care.

" I have now only to tell yon, that “ my mother insisted on my spending " this winter in a warmer climate; and " I fixed on Lisbon, as I had before vi- " fired the Continent.” Ide then looked Mary full in the taco; and, with the molt insinuating accents, asked “ if he “ might hope for her friendship 35Jjfs’�3 If lire " would rely on him as if he was her fa- " ther; and that the tendercsl father " could not more anxiously interest him- " self in the fate of a darling child, than “ he did in her’s.”,Such a crowd of thoughts all at once milled into Mary'-¬,Jjfs’*'s mind, that she in vain attempted to express the sentiments which v.ere most predominant. Her heart longed to receive a new guest; there was a void in it: accustomed to have some one to love, she was alone, and comfort¬ less, if not engrossed by a particular af¬ fection.,■2 Henrv
Henry saw her distress, and not to in¬ crease it, left the room. He had exerted himself to turn her thoughts into a new channel, and had succeeded ; fae thought of him till she began to chide herself for defrauding the dead, and, determining to grieve for Ann, she dwelt on Henry’s misfortunes and ill health; and the in¬ terest he took in her fate was a balm to her sick mind. She did not reason on the subject ; but sire felt he was attached to her: lost in this delirium, sire never asked herself what kind of an a section {he had for him, or what it tended to •. nor did site know that love and friend¬ ship are very distinct; site thought with rapture, that there was one person in the world who had an affection for her, and that person site admired—had a friendship for.,He had called her his dear girl; the words might have fallen from him by accident;
accident; but they did not fall to the ground. My child ! His child, what an association of ideas! If I had had a father, such a father !—She could not dwell on the thoughts, the wishes which obtruded themselves. Her mind was unhinged, and passion unperceived filled her whole foul. Loss, in waking dreams, the con¬ sidered and reconsidered Henry’s ac¬ count of himself; till she actually thought sne would tell Ann—a bitter recollec¬ tion then roused her out of her reverie; and aloud she begged forgiveness os her.,By these kind of conflicts the day was lengthened; and when she went to bed, the night passed away in feverish slum¬ bers ; though they did not refresh her, the was spared the labour of thinking, of restraining her imagination; it sported uncontrouled ; but took its colour from her waking train of thoughts. One in-,H stant

She had too much strength
strength of mind to waver in her deter¬ mination ; but to determine wrung her very heart, opened all her old wounds, and made them bleed afresh. What vyas (he to do ? where go ? Could she set a seal to a hasty vow, and tell a deliberate lie; promise to love one man, when the image of another was ever present to her —her foul revolted.

The day was fine; but all nature was to her a universal blank; she could neither enjoy it, nor weep that she could not. She passed by the ruins of an old monastery on a very high hill; she got out to walk amongst the ruins; the wind blew violently, she did not avoid its fury, on the contrary, wildly bid jt blow on, and seemed glad to ccmtenj with it, or rather walk against it. Ex hausted, she returned to the carriage was soon at home, and in the old room.,Henry started at the sight of her al- tered appearance; the day before her H j com-

He was not well, his ill¬ ness was apparent in his countenance, and he owned he had not closed his eyes all night ; this roused her dormant ten¬ derness, she forgot they were so soon to part—engrossed by the present happiness of feeing, of hearing him.,Once or twice sire essayed to tell him that fne was, in a few days, to depart, but fne could not; she was irresolute; it will do to-morrow; should the wind change they could not sail in such a hurry j thus she thought, and insensibly grew more calm. The Ladies pre¬ vailed on her to spend the evening with them ; but she retired very early to rest, and fat on the side of her bed severed hours, then threw herself on it, and waited for the dreaded to-morrow.,C II A P.
( i-J ),C H A P. XVIII.,The ladies heard that her Eirant was to be married that day, and that she was to fail in the vessel which was then clear¬ ing out at the Custom-house. Henry heard, but did not make any remarks, and Mary called up all her fortitude to support her, and enable her to hide from the females her internal struggles. She durst not encounter Henry’s glances when she found he had been informed of her intention; and, trying to draw a veil over her wretched state of mind, site talked incessantly, she knew not what; 6 ah es of wit burst from her, and when he began to laugh she could not stop herself,II,Henry
Henry smiled at some of her sallies, and looked at her with such benignity and compassion, that he recalled her scattered thoughts; and, the ladies going to dress for dinner, they were left alone; and remained silent a few moments: after the noisy conversation it appeared solemn. Henry began. " You are " g ing, Mary, and going by yourself; " your mind is not in a (bate to be left ° to its own operations - yet I cannot, " dissuade you ; if I attempted to do it, " I should ill deserve the title I wish to " merit. I only think of your happiness; " could I obey the strongest impulse ot " my heart, I should accompany thee " to England; but such a step might “ endanger your future peace.”,Mary, then, with all the frank nest which marked her character, explained her situation to him, and mentioned her fatal
( 1Iilt!’ICce0OoDd0OoCce6°05 ),fatal tie with such disgust that he trembled for her. " I cannot see him ; he is not " the man formed for me to love!" Her delicacy did not restrain her, for her dislike to her husband had taken root in her mind long before she knew Henry. Did flic not fix on Lisbon rather than France on purpose to avoid him ? and if Ann had been in tolerable health she would have flown with her to some re¬ mote corner to have el caped from him.," I intend,” said Henry, " to follow “ you in the next packet; where shall I ,'■1Iil|—’'• hear of your health ?” " Oh ! let me “ hear of thine," replied Maty. " I “ am well, very well ; but thou art very “ ill—thy health is in the most preca- " rious state.” She then mentioned her intention of going to Ann’s relations. " I am her representative, I have duties to fulfil for her: during my voyage I,“ I shall
( io6 ),have time enough for reflection; though rc I think I have already determined.” ■ " Be not too hasty, my child,” inter¬ rupted Henry ; ■“ far be it from me to " persuade thee to do violence to thy " feelings—but consider that all thy su- " sure life may probably take its colour " from thy present mode of conduct. " Our affections as well as our fenti- " ments are fluctuating; you will not,perhaps always either think or feel th “ you do at present: the object you now " statin may appear in a different light.rPp"'r',■1Iil‘’' He paused. " In advising thee in this " style, I have only thy good at heart, *4<<(Ccet:rE£c Mary,”,She only answered to expostulate.,■" My affections are involuntary—yet they can only be fixed by reflection, °" and when they are they make quite a part of my foul, arc interwoven in it, animate

Milton has af- ferted, That earthly love is the scale by which to heavenly we may as¬ cend.”,She went on with eagerness. " My opinions on some kibjccts are not wavering; my puriuit through life has ever been the fame : in lolitude were my sentiments formed ; they are inde¬ lible, and nothing can efface them but death-No, death itself cannot efface them, or my foul must be created afrclh, and not improved, " Yet

She still continued. " The “ same turn of mind which leads me to “ adore the Author of all Perfection — “ which leads me to conclude that he “ only can fill my sous; forces me to " admire the faint image—the shadows of his attributes here below; and my k-¬'°' imagination gives still bolder strokes “ to them.

" Every cause in nature produces an " effect; and am I an exception to the " general rule? have I desires implanted “ in me only to make me miserable ? “ will they never be gratified ? shall I " never be happy ? My feelings do " not accord with the notion of solitary “ happiness. In a state of bliss, it will “ be the society of beings we can love, " without the alloy that earthly infirmr- " ties mix with our best affections, that " will constitute great part of our hap- “ piness.," With these notions can I conform " to the maxims of worldly wisdom ?," can.

source of all virtue and truth. He wa, startled, if not entirely convinced by her arguments; indeed her voice, her ges¬ tures were all persuasive.,Some one now entered the room ; he looked an answer to her long harangue; it was fortunate for him, or he might have been led to say what in a cooler moment he had determined to conceal; but were words necessary to reveal it? He wished not to influence her conduct- vain precaution; she knew she was be¬ loved ; and could she forget that such a man loved her, or rest satisfied with any inferior gratification. When passion first enters the heart, it is only a return of affection, that is fought after, and every other remembrance and wish is blotted out.,CHAP.
CHA P. XIX.,1 WO days passed away without any particular conversation; Henry, trying to be indifferent, or to appear so, was more assiduous than ever. The conflict was too violent lor his present state of health ; the spirit was willing, but the body suffered; he lost his appetite, and looked wretchedly; his spirits were calm¬ ly low—the world leemed to fade away —what was that world to him that Mary did not inhabit; Ilie lived not for him.,He was mistaken; his affection was her only support; without this dear prop she had sunk into the grave of her lost —long-loved friend;— his attention I snatched

Inscrutable are the ways of Heaven!,The third day Mary was desired to prepare herself; for is the wind continued in the fame point, they should set fail the next evening. She tried to prepare her mind, and her efforts were not use¬ less; site appeared less agitated than could have been expected, and talked of her voyage with composure. On great occasions she was generally calm and collected, her resolution would brace her unstrung nerves; but after the victory she had no triumph; she would fink into a state of moping melancholy, and feel ten-fold misery when the heroic enthu- siafm was over.,The morning of the day fixed on for her departure she was alone with Henry only a few moments, and an awkward kind of formality made them flip away without,2
without their having said much to each other. Henry was afraid to discover his passion, or give any other name to his regard but friendship; yet his anxious solicitude for her welfare was ever break¬ ing out—while flic as artlessly expressed again and again, her fear.s with respect to his declining health.," We shall soon meet,” said he, with a faint smile; Mary smiled too; she caught the sickly beam; it was still fainter by being reflected, and not know¬ ing what fine wished to do, started up and left the room. When she was alone she regretted she had left him so precipitately. " The few precious mo- " ments I have thus thrown away may " never return,” she thought—the re¬ flection led to misery.,She waited for, nay, almost wished for the summons to depart. She could,I ' nor
not avoid spending the intermediate time with the ladies and Henry ; and the tri¬ vial conversations fae was obliged to bear a part in harassed her more than, can be well conceived.,The summons came, and the whole party attended her to the vessel. For a while the remembrance of Ann banished her regret at parting with Henry, though his pale figure pressed on her sight; it may seem a paradox, but he was more present to her when site sailed : her tears rhea were all his own.," My poor Ann s' thought Marv, " along this road we came, and near this ;,i<4'<;fsrCcet?r spot you called me your guardian an- “ gel —and now I leave thee here I ah',1Iil|—!’*'. 61Iilte8‘*6;:i1IlZz‘£1 no, I do not—thy spirit is not con- ;:fsr;;;:; fined to its mouldering tenement! 1IilaSs5$1•,fs1Iil|—t‘*�1 Tell me, thou foul of her I love, tell " me,, ah’ whither art thou fled?” Ann occupied

On this bed she remained two days, listening to the dashing waves, unable to close her eyes. A small taper made the darkness visible; and the third night, by its glimmering light, she wrote the following fragment.," Poor solitary wretch that I am; " here alone do I listen to the whistling " winds and dashing waves;—on no " human support can I rest - when not " lost to hope I found pleasure in the " society of those rough beings; but " now they appear not like my fellow " creatures; no social tics draw me to “ them.

HE mate of the ship, who heard be¬ stir, came to offer her some refreshment; and she, who formerly received every offer of kindness or civility with pleasure, now shrunk away disgusted: peevishly she desired him not to disturb her; bur the words were hardly articulated when her heart smote her, she called him back, and requested something to drink. Aster drinking it, fatigued by her mental ex¬ ertions, flic fell into a death- like slumber, which lasted some hours; but did not refresh her, on the contrary, she awoke languid and stupid.,The wind still continued contrary; a week, a dismal week, had she struggled
( III ),with her sorrows; and the struggle brought on a flow fever, which some¬ times gave her false spirits.,The winds then became very tem¬ pestuous, the Great Deep was troubled, and all the passengers appalled. Mary then left her bed, and went on deck, to survey the contending elements: the scene accorded with the present state os her soul; flic thought in a few hours I may go home; the prisoner may be re- kased. The vessel rose on a wave and descended into a yawning gulph—Not flower did her mounting soul return to earth, for—Ah! her treasure and her heart was there. The squalls rattled amongst the sails, which were quickly taken down; the wind would then die away, and the wild undirected waves rushed on every fide with a tremendous roar. In a little vessel in the midst of such
such a storm she was not dismayed, jhc felt herself independent.,J ut i then one of the crew perceived a signal of distress; by the help of a glass he could plainly discover a small vessel dismasted, drifted about, for the rudder had been broken by the violence of the storm. Mary’s thoughts wei e now all engrossed by the crew on the brink of destruction. They bore down to the wreck; they reached it, and hailed the trembling wretches: at the found of the friendly greeting, loud cries of tumul¬ tuous joy were mixed with the roaring of die waves, and with ecstatic transport they leaped on the shattered deck, launched their boat in a moment, and !i1IlSs‘’“1 committed themselves to the mercy of the sea. Stowed between two casks, and leaning on a sail, she watched the boar, and when a wave intercepted it from her,view—

She returned again to view the angry deep ; and when lire gazed on its perturbed state, she thought of the Be;ng who rode on the wings of the wind, and fulled the node of the ka, and the madness ot the people—1 le only
-only could speak peace to her troubled spirit! she grew more calm; the late ■transaction had gratified her benevolence, and stole her out of herself.,One of the sailors, happening to fay to another, " that he believed the work! ;1IilZz!£1,t1IilZz£'1 was going to be at an end s’ this observation led her into a new train of thoughts: some of Handel’s lubbmv compositions occurred to her, and 11 w fung them to the grand accompaniment. The Lord God Omnipotent reigned, and would reign for ever, and ever!—Why then did Hie fear the sorrows that were passing away, when she knew that He would bind up the broken-hearted, and .receive those who came out of great tribulation. She retired to her cabin-, and wrote in the little book that was now her only confident. It was after -midnight.,At

The poor woman, oppressed by it, and her many other cares, after an in¬ undation of tears, began to enumerate all her pass misfortunes, and present cares. The heavy talc hissed until midnight, and the impression it made on Mary’s mind was lb strong, that it banished Heep till towards morning; when tired nature fought forgetfulness, and the foul ceased to ruminate about many things.,She sent for the poor woman they took up at sea, provided her a lodging, and relieved her present necessities. A few days were spent in a kind of listless way; then the mother of Ann began to enquire when she thought of returning home. She had hitherto treated her with the greatest respect, and concealed,K 3 her
( *34 ),her wonder at Mary’s choosing a remote room in the horse near the garden, and ordering some alterations to be made, as if flie intended living in it.,Mary did not choose to explain hers If ; had Ann lived, it is probable Ine would never have loved Henry so fondly ; but if hie had, she could not have talked oi her passion to any human creature. She deliberated, and at last informed tin family, that she had a reason for not being with her husband, which must some time remain a secret—they stared —Net live with him ! how will you live then ? This was a question she could not answer; she had only about eighty pounds remaining, of the money (he took with her to Lisbon; when it was exhausted where could she get more?

She was in the vicinity of a great city; the vicious poor in and about it must ever grieve a benevolent contemplative mind.,One evening a man who flood weep¬ ing in a little lane, near the house flic resided in, caught her eye. She accosted him; in a confused manner, he informed her, that his wife was dying, and his children crying for the bread he could nor,K 4 earn.
( t36 ),earn. Mary desired to be conducted to his habitation; it was not vciy didara, and was the upper room in an old mansion-house, which had been once the abode os luxury. Some tattered sored; of rich hangings still remained, covered with cobwebs and filth ; round the ceil¬ ing, through which the rain drop’d, was a beautiful cornice mouldering ; and a spacious gallery was rendered dark, by the broken windows being blocked up; through the apertures the wind forced its way in hollow founds, and reverberated along the former scene of festivity.,It was crowded with inhabitants: fom were scolding, others swearing, or singing indecent songs. What a fight for Mary! Her blood ran cold; yet she had suffi¬ cient resolution to mount to the top of the house. On the floor, in one,3,corner
( ’37 ),corner of a very small room, lay an emaciated figure of a woman ; a window over her head scarcely admitted any liebt, for the broken panes were Ruffed with dirty rags. Near her were five chil¬ dren, all young, and covered with dirt; their fallow checks, and languid eves, exhibited none of the charms of child¬ hood. Some were figuring, and others crying for food; their yells were mixed with their mother’s groans, and the wind which rushed through the passage. Mary was petrified ; but soon assuming more courage, approached the bed, and, regardless of the surrounding nastiness, knelt down by the poor wretch, and breathed the molt poisonous air; for the unfortunate creature was dying of a putrid sever, the consequence of dirt and want.,Their state did not require much expla¬ nation.
nation. Mary sent the husband for a poor neighbour, whom she .hired to nurse the woman, and take care or me children; and then went herlelt to buy them some necessaries at a shop not far distant. Her knowledge or physic had enabled her to prescribe for the woman ; and Ike left the house, with a mixture of horror and satisfaction.,She visited them every day, and pro¬ cured them every comfort; contrary to her expectation, the woman began to reco¬ ver; cleanliness and wholesome food had a wonderful effect; and Mary law her rising as it were from the grave. Not aware of the danger she ran into, sire did not think of it till she perceived she had caught the fever. It made such an alarming progress, that flic was prevailed on to fend for a physician ; but the disorder was so violent, that far some days it baffled
baffled his skill; and Mary felt not her danger, as Ilic was delirious. After the crisis, the symptoms were more favour¬ able, and flic llov.lv recovered, without regaining much strength or spirits; indeed they were intolerably low: flic wanted a tender nude.,For some time she had observed, that she was not treated with the fame respect as formerly ; her favors were for¬ gotten when no more were expected. This ingratitude hurt her, as did a similar instance in the woman who came out of the fliip. Mary had hitherto supported her; as her finances were growing low, flic hinted to her, that flic ought to try to earn her own subsistence : the woman in return loaded her with abuse.,Two months were elapsed; she had not seen, w heard from Henrv. He,was

She sent for the poor woman ssie found in the garret; gave her money to clothe her! elf
herself and children, and buy some fur¬ niture for a little hut, in a large garden, the master of which agreed to employ her husband, who had been bred a gar¬ dener. Mary promised to »visit the fa¬ mily, and fee their new abode when flic was able to go out.,C I I A P.
( *4+ ),■ CHAP. XXIV.,Mary still continued weak and low, though it was spring, and all nature began to look gay; with more than must brightness the fun shone, and a little robin which she had cherished during the winter sung one of his best songs. The family were particularly civil this fae morning, and tried to prevail on her to walk out. Any thing like kindness mel¬ ted her; she consented.,Softer emotions banished her melan¬ choly, and sire directed her steps to the habitation she had rendered comfortable.,Emerging out of a dreary chamber, all nature looked cheerful; when she had last walked out, snow covered the ground,
ground, and bleak winds pierced her through and through : now the hedges were green, the blmf >ms adorned the trees, and the birds king. She reached the dwelling, without being much ex¬ hausted ; and while fire rested there, ob¬ served the children sporting on the grafs, with improved complexions. The mother with tears thanked her deliverer, and pointed out her comforts. Mary’s tears flowed not only from sympathy, but a complication of feelings and recol¬ lections ; the affections which bound her to her fellow creatures began again to play, and reanimated nature. She ob¬ served the change in herself, tried to account for it, and wrote with her pencil a rhapsody on sensibility.,“ Sensibility is the most exquisite “ feeling of which the human foul is fuf- “ ceptible : when it pervades us, we feel,L " happy
" happy; and could it lad unmixed, vm “ might form sone conjecture of the “ bliss of those piradifiacai days, v.iun “ the obedient passions were u nder :i,u " dominion of reason, and. die impaiitcs “ of the heart d.d not need, correction.," It is this quickneis, tins delicacy of “ feeling, which enables us to relish tiw “ h blime toncb.es ot the poet, and the " paint, r; it is this, which expands die " foul, gives an enthusiastic greauich, " mixed with tenderness, when we v,ew “ the magnificent objects oi nature ; or " liear or a good action. The lame " effect we experience in the spring, " when we hail the returning fun, and “ the consequent renovation of nature; " when the flowers unfold themlelvcs, " and exhale their sweets, and the voice " of music is heard in the land. Sof- " tened by tenderness; the foul is dif- " posed
posed to be virtuous. Is any sensual gratification to be compared to that of " feeling the eyes mmstmcd after having “ comforted the unfortunate ?," Sensibility is indeed the founda- tion of all our happiness; but these " raptures are unknown to the depraved " sensualist, who is only moved by what “ strikes his gross senses; the delicate em- bellilhments of nature escape his no- " ticc; as do the gentle and interesting af- “ sections.—But it is only to be felt; it,escapes discussion.”,She then returned home, and partook of the family meal, which was rendered more cheerful by the presence of a man, past the meridian of life, of polished manners, and dazzling wit. He endea- •■cured to draw Mary out, and succeeded; she entered into conversation, and some of her artless flights of genius struck,L 2 him
( US ),him with surprise; he found hie had a capacious mind, and that her reason was as profound as her imagination was lively. Site glanced from earth to heaven, and caught the light of truth. Her ■expressive countenance shewed what .passed in her mind, and her tongue was ever the faithful interpreter of her heart > duplicity never threw a shade over her words or actions. Mary found him a man of learning; and the exercise of her ■understanding would frequently make her forget her griefs, when nothing elk could, except benevolence.,This man had known the mistress of the house in her youth; good nature induced him to visit her; but when he saw Mary he had another inducement. Her appearance, and above all, her genius, and cultivation of mind, roused his curiosity; but her dignified manners had
(. 149 ),had such an effect, on him, he was obliged, to suppress it. He knew men, as well as books; his conversation was enter¬ taining and improving. In Mary’s company lie doubted whether heaven was peopled with splits malculine ; and almost forgot that he had called the sex “ the pretty play tilings that render lite “ tolerable.”,I Ie had been the slave ol beauty, the captive of lense; love he ne’er had felt; the mind never rivetted the chain, nor had the purity of it made the body ap¬ pear lovely in his eyes. He was humane, despised meanness; but was vain of his abilities, and by no means a useful member of society. He talked often of the beauty of virtue ; but not having any solid foundation to build the practice on, he was only a shining, or rather a sparkling character : and though his,L 3 fortune
( ’5° ),fortune enabled him to hunt down plea¬ sure, he was dilcontented.,Mary observed his character, and wrote down a train of reflections, which these observations led her to make; these reflections received a tinge from her mind ; the present date of it, w ■; that kind of painful quietness which amb. from reason clouded by disgust ; lire he: not yet learned to be i esigned; vamu hopes agitated her.,<(,1Iil‘’*1-¬,1Iil>'*‘1 There are fume subjects that are lb “ enveloped in clouds, as you distpaw " one, another overspreads it. Of this " kind are our reasonings concerning " happiness, till we are obliged to erv " out with the Apostle, sw/ it bath “ not entered into the heart of man to con- " tfive in what it could coufst, or how " satiety could be prevented. Man “ seems formed for action, though the " passions
( *9 ),“ passions are seldom properly managed; " they are either so languid as not to " serve as a spur, or elie so violent, as “ to overleap all bounds.,“ Every individual has its own pecu- " liar trials; and anguish, in one shape “ or other, visits every heart. Sensibility " produces flights of virtue ; and not " curbed by reason, is on the brink of “ vice talking, and even thinking of ,1Iilk'‘*1,t1IilCce<‘'1 virtue.,“ Christianity can only afford juft prin- " ciples to govern the wayward feelings " and impulses of the heart: every good “ disposition runs wild, it not trans- *• planted into this foil; but how hard “ is it to keep the heart diligently, " though convinced that the issues of " life depend on it.," It is very difficult to discipline tire " mind of a thinker, or reconcile him,L 4 *1Iilt,<'’*' to
" to the weakness, the inconsistency oi " his understanding; and a still more " laborious task for him to conquer " his passions, and learn to seek content, “ instead of happiness. Good depositions, " and virtuous propensities, without the " light of the Gospel, produce eccentric " characters: comet-like, they are always " in extremes; while revelation resembles “ the laws of attraction, and produces " uniformity; but too often is the " attraction feeble; and the light so " obscured by passion, as to force the " bewildered foul to fly into void space, ° and wander in confusion.”,C H A P.
CHAP. XXV.,A FEW mornings after, as Marywa; fitting ruminating, harassed by per¬ plexing thoughts, and fears, a letter was delivered to- her: the servant waited for an answer. Her heart palpitated ; it was from Henry ; she held it some time- in her hand, then tore it open ; it was not a long one; and only contained an account of a relapse, which prevented his failing in the Aril packet, as he had intended. Some tender enquiries were added, concerning her health, and Fate of mind; but they were expressed in rather a formal style : it vexed her, and the more so, as it flopped the current of affection, which the account of his arrival and illness had made flow to her heart
heart—it ceased to beat for a moment — lire read the passage over again; but could not tell what flic was hurt by—only that it did not answer the expectations of her affection. She wrote a laconic, incohe¬ rent note in return, allowing him to call on her the next day—he had requested permission at the conclusion of his letter.,Her mind was then painfully active; she could not read or walk; she tried to fly from herself, to forget the long hours that were yet to run before to-moirow could arrive : flic knew not what time he would come ; certainly in the morning, she concluded; the morning then was anxiously wished for; and every wish pro¬ duced a sigh, that arose from expectation on the stretch, damped by fear and vain regret.,To beguile the tedious time, Henry’s favorite tunes were fung; the beexs they
( i55 ),they read together turned over; and the short epistle read at least a hundred times.—Any one who who had , seen her, would have supposed that she was trying to decypher Chinese characters.,Aster a sleepless night, she hailed the tndv day, watched the rising fun, and then listened for every footstep, and started if site heard the street door opened. At last he came, and she who had been counting the hours, and doubting whether the earth moved, would gladly have escaped the approach¬ ing interview.,With an unequal, irresolute pace, Le went to meet him; but when Le beheld his emaciated countenance, all the ten¬ derness, which the formality of his letter had damped, returned, and a mournful presentiment stilled the internal conflict,. She caught his hand, and looking wist¬ fully
fully at him, exclaimed, " Indeed, vgu are not well!”," I am very far from well; but it " matters not,” added he with a Imile of resignation ; " my native air may work " wonders, and besides, my mother h a " tender nurse, and I shall sometimes he " thee.”,Mary felt for the first time in her life, envy; she wished involuntarily, dm all the comfort he received should be from her. She enquired about the symptoms of his disorder ; and heard that he had been very ill; sire hastily drove away the fears, that former dear bought experience suggested : and again and again did she repeat, that she was lure he would soon recover. She would then look in his face, to fee if he assented, and a sic more questions to the same pur¬ port. She tried to avoid speaking or herself,
herself, and Henry left her, w th a pro¬ mise of visitin,■•<'’'?; her the next day.,Her mind was now engrossed by one fear —vet He would not allow i.cdclf to think that Hie feared an event site could not name, Site ibll law ms pile face; l.i-sound of his voice still vibrated on her cars; she tried to retain it; she lis¬ tened, looked round, wept, and graved.,Henry had enlightened the deso¬ late icene: was this charm of life to fade away, and, like the baseless fabric of a vi¬ sion, leave not a wreck behind ? These thoughts disturbed her reason, site shook her head, as if to drive them out of it; a weight, a heavy one, was on her heart; all was not well there.,Out of this reverie she was soon v.oke to keener anguish, by the arrival of a letter from her husband; it came to Lisbon after her departure; Henry had,.forwarded
forwarded it to her, bur did net chotw to deliver it himself, for a very obvious reason ; it might have produced a con¬ versation he visited for some time u avoid; and his precaution took its rife almost equally from benevolence and love.,She could not mutter up sufficient resolution to break rhe seal: her ieao were not prophetic, for the contents gave her comfort. He informed her that he intended prolonging his tour, as he win now his own matter, and wished to remain some time on the continent, and in par¬ ticular to visit Italy without any restraint: but his reasons for it appeared childish; it was not to cultivate his take, cr tread on clastic ground, where poets an 1 philosophers caught their lore; but to joi" in the masquerades, and such burlesque amusements.,3 '
These instances of folly relieve.! Mary, in fame degree reconciled her to herself added fuel to the devouring flame - and silenced something like a pang, which reason and conscience made iter seel, when site reflected, that it is the office of Religion to reconcile us to the seemingly hard dispensations. of providence ; and that no inclination, however Mong, should oblige us to desert the post as¬ signed us, or force us to forget that virtue should be an active principle? and that the most desirable Ration, is the one that exercises our faculties, refines our affections, and enables us to be useful.,One reflection continually wounded her repose? she feared not poverty? her wants were few; but in giving up a fortune, fne gave up the power of comforting the miserable, and making the fad heart sing for jov.,Heaven
Heaven had endowed her with u:i- common humanity, to render Iter one of His benevolent agents, a mcfkngcr of peace; and should site attend to he own inclinations ?,These suggestions, though they could not subdue a violent passion, incicalH her misery. One moment she was a he- troine, half determined to bear whatever fate should inflict; the next, her mind would recoil—and tenderness possessed her whole foul. Some instances os Henry’s affection, his worth and genius, were remembered: and the earth was only a vale of tears, because he was not lo sojourn with her.,c ii a r.
CHAP. XXVI.,HeNRY came the next day, and once or twice in the course of the fol¬ lowing week; but still Mary kept up some little formality, a certain consci¬ ousness restrained her ; and Henry did not enter on die subject which he found she wished to avoid. In the course of conversation, however, she mentioned to him, that she earnestly desired to obtain a place in one of the public offices for Ann’s brother, as the family were again in a declining way.,Henry attended, made a few enquiries, and dropped die subject ; but the follow¬ ing week, ffie heard him enter with un¬ usual haste; it was to inform her, that M he
he had made interest with a person es some consequence, whom he had once obliged in a very disagreeable exigency, in a foreign country ; and that he sad procured a place for her friend, vhics would infallibly lead to something better, if he behaved with propriety. Marv could not speak to thank him; emotions of gratitude and love suffused her face, her blood eloquently spoke. She de¬ lighted to receive benefits through the medium of her fellow creatures; but to receive them from Henry was ex¬ quisite pleasure.,As the summer advanced, Henry grew worse ; the closeness of the air, in the metropolis, affected his breath; and his mother insisted on his fixing on ion e place in the country, where ihe would accompany him. He could not think of going far off, but chose a Ik tie vil¬ lage
hge on the banks of the Thames, near Marv’s dwelling: he then introduced her to his mother.,They frequently went down the river in a boat; Henry would take his violin, and Mary would sometimes sing, or read, to them. She pleased his mother; (lie in- chantcd him. It was an advantage to Ma¬ ry that friendship first:poflefied her heart; it opened it to all the softer sentiments of humanityand when this first af¬ fection v as torn away, a similar one sprung up, with a Kill tenderer sentiment added to it.,The last evening they were on the water, the clouds grew suddenly black, and broke in violent showers, which interrupted the solemn stillness that had prevailed previous to it. The thunder roared ; and the oars giving quickly, in order to reach the shore, occasioned a,M ',■1Iil’‘'i Di.it
not unpleasing sound. Mary drew still nearer Henry ; sire wished to have sought with him a watry grave; to have escaped the horror of surviving him.— She spoke not, but Henry saw the workings of her mind—he felt them ; threw his arm round her waist— and they enjoyed the luxury of wretchedness.—As they touched the shore, Mary perceived that Henry was wet; with eager anxiety she cried, What lhall I do !—this day will kill thee, and I shall not die with thee !,This accident put a stop to their pleasurable excursions; it had injured him, and brought on the spitting of blood he was subject: to—perhaps it was not the cold that he caught, that occa¬ sioned it. In vain did Mary try to shut her eyes; her fate pursued her! Henry every day grew worse and worse.,CHAP.
CHAP. XXVII.,Oppressed by her foreboding fears, her fore mind was hurt by new instances of ingratitude: disgusted with the family, whose misfortunes had often disturbed her repose, and lost in antici¬ pated sorrow, (he rambled she knew not where; when turning down a shady walk, she discovered her feet had taken the path they delighted to tread. She saw Henry fitting in his garden alone j he quickly opened the garden-gate, and she fat down by him," I did not,” said he, " expect to see “ thee this evening, my dearest Mary; " but I was thinking of thee.

A mournful fi- hnce ensued ! when he resumed the con¬ versation. " I wished to prepare thee for “ the blow —too surely do 1 feel that “ it will not be long delayed ! The “ passion I have nursed is so pure, that " death cannot extinguish it—or tear “ away the impression thy virtues have “ made on my soul. I would fain com- “ fort thee—”," Talk not of comfort,” interrupted Mary, " it will be in heaven with thee “ and Ann -while I shall remain on " earth the veriest wretch She grasp¬ ed his hand.," There we Hall meet, my love, “ my Mary, in our Father,■1Iil'’‘'s-His voice,M 4 faltered;
faultered; he could not finish the sen¬ tence ; he was almost suffocated - they both wept, their tears relieved them; they walked slowly to the garden-gate (Mary would not go into the house); they could not say sarewel when they reached it —and Mary hurried down the lane, to spare Henry the pain of wit¬ nessing her emotions.,When she lost fight of the house she sat down on the ground, till it grew late, thinking of all that had passed. Full of these thoughts, she crept along, regardless os the descending rain ; when lifting up her eyes to heaven, and then turning them wildly on the prospects around, without marking them; she only felt that the scene accorded with her present state of mind. It was the last glimmering of twilight, with a full moon, over which clouds continually flitted.
( i69 ),flitted. Where am I wandering, God of Mercy! she thought; she alluded to the wanderings of her mind. In what a labyrinth am I lost 1 What mi¬ series have I already encountered —and what a number lie Rill before me.,Her thoughts flew rapidly to some¬ thing. I could be happy listening to him, soothing his cares. ■ Would he not smile upon me— call me his own Man,•"■'-¬_’�- ? 1 am not his - said fire with fierceness — I am a wretch! and flic heaved a sigh that almost broke her heart, while the big tears rolled down her burning cheeks; but still her exercised mind, accustomed to think, began to observe its operation, though the barrier of reason was almost carried away, and all the faculties not restrained by her, were running into confusion. Where¬ fore am 1 mads thus ? Vain arc mv efforts -
( '!1Iil>�'IO ),efforts - I cannot live without loving— and love leads to madness. —Yet I will not weep; and her eyes were now iix<d by despair, dry and motionless; and then quick.lv whirled about with a look of distraction.,She looked for hope ; but found none — all was troubled waters. —No where could she find rest. I have already paced to and fro in the earth ; it is not my abiding place—may I not too go home ! Ah 1 no, Is this complving with my Henry'",Jj■1Iil’'s request, could a spirit thus disengaged expect to associate with his ? Tears of tenderncis straved down her relaxed countenance, and her sof¬ tened heart heaved more regularlv. She felt the rain, and turned to her folbary home.,Fatigued by the tumultuous emotions she had endured, when she entered the house
( I?1Iiltt?1 ),house she ran to her own room, sunk on the bed, and ex!vaulted nature soon closed her eyes; but active fancy was fill awake, and a thousand fearful dreams interrupted her slumbers.,Feverish and languid, she opened her eyes, and law the unwelcome fun dart his rays through a window, the curtains of which sue had forgotten to draw. The dew hung on the adjacent trees, and added to the lustre; the little robin began his song, and distant birds joined. She looked; her countenance was still vacant--her sensibility was absorbed by one object.,Did I ever admire the rising fun, she slightly thought, turning from the win¬ dow, and shutting her eyes: fire ie- called to view the last night’s scene. His faltering voice, lingering step, and the look of tender woe, wue all graven,on
on her heart; as were the words " Could- these arms shield thee from “ sorrow - afford thee an asylum from " an unfeeling world.” The pressure to his bosom was not forgot. For a moment she was happy; but in a long- drawn sigh every delightful sensation evaporated. Soon—yes, very soon, will the grave again receive all I love ! and the remnant of my days—she could not proceed—Were there then days to come after that ?,CHAP.
CHAP. XXVIII.,Just as she was going to quit her room, to visit Henry, his mother called on her.," My son is worse to-day,” said site, “ I come to request you to spend not " only this day, but a week or two with me.—Why should I conceal any thing “ from you ?. Last night my child made his mother his confident, and, in the “ anguilh of his heart, requested me to " be thy friend—when I shall be child- " less. I will not attempt to describe “ what I felt when he talked thus to me. “ If I am to lose the support of my age, " and be asain a widow—may I call her,“ Child

Mary’s tears were not those
those of unmixed anguish; the display of his virtues gave her extreme delight —yet human nature prevailed; she trem¬ bled to think they would soon unfold themselves in a more genial clime.,CHAP.
CHAP. XXIX.,dHE found Henry very ill. The physician had some weeks before de¬ clared he never knew a person with a similar pulse recover. Henry was cer¬ tain he could not live long ; all the reft he could obtain, was procured by opi¬ ates. Mary now enjoyed the melancholy pleasure of nursing him, and softened by her tenderness the pains she could not remove. Every sigh did she stifle, every tear restrain, when he could fee or hear them. She would boast of her resignation—yet catch eagerly at the least ray of hope. While he slept she would support his pillow, and rest her head where she could feel his breath. She loved

She did so, and received comfort from it; fire rose above her misery.,His end was now approaching. Mary fat on the fide of the bed.

despair watched for his last breath. Collected, a frightful calmness stilled every turbulent emotion.,The mother’s grief was more audible. Henry had for some time only attended to Mary—Mary pitied the parent, whose, stings of conscience increased her sor¬ row; she whispered him, " Thy mothri',.°><1Iil' weeps, disregarded by thee; oh! com¬ fort her! —My mother, thy son blesses thee.—"The oppressed parent left the room. And Mary waited to fee him die.,She pressed with trembling eagernest his parched lips—he opened his eyes again; the spreading film retired, and love returned them he gave a look— it was never forgotten.

Where is Mary ? did she not lay she delighted to support me ? let me die in her arms.,Her arms were opened to receive him ; they trembled not. Again he was o- bliged to lie down, resting on her: as the agonies increased he leaned towards her: the foul seemed flying to her, as it escaped out of its prison. The breathing was interrupted; flic heard distinctly the last sigh—and lifting up to Heaven her eyes, Father, receive his spirit, she calmly cried.,The attendants gathered round; she moved not, nor heard the clamor; the hand seemed yet to prefs hers; it still,N 2 was

( ^2 ),CHAP. XXX.,THREE months after, her only friend, the mother of her lost Henry began to be alarmed, at observing her altered appearance; and made her own health a pretext for travelling. These complaints roused Mary out of her torpid state; she imagined a new duty now forced her to exert herself—a duty love made sacred !—,They went to Bath, from that to Bristol; but the latter place they quickly left; the sight of the sick that resort there, they neither of them could bear. From Bristol they flew to South¬ ampton. The road was pleasant yet Mary shut her eyesor if they were open,
( 1*3 ),open, green fields and commons, pas¬ sed in quick succession, and left no more traces behind than if they had been waves us the sea.,Some time after they were fettled at Southampton, they met the man who took so much notice of Marv, soon after her return to England. He re¬ newed his acquaintance; he was really interested in her fate, as he had heard her uncommon story ; besides, he knew her husband; knew him to be a good- natured, weak man. Fie saw him soon after his arrival in his native country, and prevented his hastening to enquire into the reasons of Mary’s strange con- duct. He desired him not to be too precipitate, if he ever wished to possess an invaluable treasure. He was guided by him, and allowed him to follow Mary to Southampton, and speak first to her friend.,This
This friend determined to trust to her native strength of mind, and in¬ formed her of the circumstance; but she overrated it: Mary was not able, for a few days after the intelligence, to fix on the mode of conduct: she ought now to pursue. But at last she con¬ quered her disgust, and wrote her hujband an account of what had pasted since flic had dropped his correspondence.,He came in person to answer the letter. Mary fainted when he approached her unexpectedly. Her disgust returned with additional force, in spite of pre¬ vious reasonings, whenever he ap¬ peared ; yet she was prevailed on to pro i :ife to live with him, if he would permit her to pass one year, travelling from place to place ; he was not to ac- ccmpanv her.,The time too quickly elapsed, and she
( -8$ ),she gave him her hand—the struggle was almost more than site could en¬ dure. She tried to appear calm; time mellowed her grief, and mitigated her torments; but when her husband would take her hand, or mention any thing like love, sire would instantly feel a sickness, a faintness at her heart, and wish, involuntarily, that the earth would open and swallow her.,C H A P.
C H A P. XXXI.,Mar Y visited the continent, and sought health in different climates ; but her nerves were not to be restored to their former state. She then retired to her house in the country, established manufactories, threw the estate into small farms; and continually employed herself this way to dissipate care, and banish unavailing regret. She visited the lick, supported the old, and educated the young.,These occupations engrossed her mind; but there were hours when ah her former woes would return and haunt her.—Whenever she did, or said, any thing she thought Henry would have approved
( i87 ),Approved of—she could not avoid think¬ ing with anguish, of the rapture his approbation ever conveyed to her heart — a heart in which there was a void, that even benevolence and religion could not fill. The latter taught her to strug¬ gle for resignation ; and the former rendered life supportable,,Iler delicate state of health did not promise long life. In moments of so¬ litary sadness, a gleam of joy would dart across her mind—She thought sire was hastening to that world where there is neither marrying, nor giving in mar¬ riage.,E N D.
